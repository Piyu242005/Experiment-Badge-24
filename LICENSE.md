**LICENSE.md — In-Depth Explanation (Simple Language)**

**What is LICENSE.md**

* `LICENSE.md` is a file that **defines legal rules** for using your project.
* It tells others **what they can and cannot do** with your code.

**Why it is important**

* Protects **your ownership**.
* Avoids **legal confusion**.
* Required for **open-source projects**.
* Helps companies decide if they can use your code.

**What it usually contains**

* License name (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
* Copyright holder and year.
* Permissions (use, modify, distribute).
* Conditions (credit, license copy).
* Limitations (no warranty, no liability).

**Common Types of Licenses**

* **MIT License**: Very permissive; only credit required.
* **Apache 2.0**: Like MIT + patent protection.
* **GPL**: Modified code must stay open-source.
* **BSD**: Similar to MIT, minimal restrictions.
* **Proprietary**: No reuse without permission.

**When to add LICENSE.md**

* Always add it when publishing code publicly.
* Without it, others **legally cannot use** your code.

**Best Practice**

* Choose a license based on how open you want your project.
* Use standard license text without modification.
