**GitHub File Reading Priority (Ranking)**

GitHub gives **highest importance** to certain files for understanding a repository.

**Top-Ranked Files (Auto-Recognized by GitHub)**

1. **`README.md`**

   * First file shown on the repository page
   * Explains project purpose, setup, and usage

2. **`LICENSE` / `LICENSE.md`**

   * Defines legal usage rights
   * Clearly shown by GitHub

3. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**

   * Shown in the **Contribute** section
   * Guides contributors

4. **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**

   * Displayed in the Community section
   * Sets behavior rules

5. **`SECURITY.md`**

   * Appears in Security tab
   * Explains vulnerability reporting

6. **`CHANGELOG.md`**

   * Tracks version updates
   * Not auto-pinned, but widely expected

**Code Files (Lower Priority Than Docs)**

* `*.py`, `*.js`, `*.java`, etc.
* Read **after README** for implementation details

**GitHub Reading Order (Practical)**

1. README
2. LICENSE
3. CONTRIBUTING
4. CODE_OF_CONDUCT
5. SECURITY
6. Source Code

**Summary:**
GitHub prioritizes **documentation files first**, especially `README.md`, before any code files.
