**SECURITY.md — In-Depth Explanation (Simple Language)**

**What is SECURITY.md**

* A standard file in a repository that explains **how to report security issues**.
* It helps protect users and the project from misuse or attacks.

**Main Purpose**

* Tell researchers **where and how** to report vulnerabilities.
* Avoid public disclosure before a fix is ready.

**Typical Sections**

1. **Supported Versions**

   * Lists versions that still receive security fixes.
   * Example:

     * v2.x ✅ Supported
     * v1.x ❌ Not supported

2. **Reporting a Vulnerability**

   * Clear steps to report issues.
   * Usually includes:

     * Email address or security contact
     * Private reporting method (not GitHub issues)
     * What details to include (steps, impact, screenshots)

3. **Response Timeline**

   * Expected time to acknowledge and fix.
   * Example:

     * Acknowledgement: 48 hours
     * Fix: 7–14 days

4. **Disclosure Policy**

   * Rules for public disclosure.
   * Often requests **responsible disclosure** after fix release.

5. **Security Practices (Optional)**

   * Use of encryption, authentication, dependency scanning.
   * Bug bounty details (if any).

**Why SECURITY.md is Important**

* Builds **trust** with users.
* Prevents **zero-day exposure**.
* Required for many **open-source and enterprise projects**.

**Best Practice**

* Keep it short, clear, and updated.
* Place it in the **root of the repository**.

If you want, I can provide a **professional SECURITY.md template** suitable for GitHub projects.
