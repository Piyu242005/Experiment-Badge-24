For GitHub, it is better to keep it short, clean, and slightly professional. Here are suitable options:

**Minimal & Clean**

* “Lovely Boy”
* “Just a lovely boy building cool things.”
* “Lovely boy with a love for code.”

**Tech + Personality**

* “Lovely boy who writes code and solves problems.”
* “Lovely boy exploring technology, data, and ideas.”
* “Lovely boy learning, building, and improving.”

**Developer Style**

* “Lovely boy passionate about development and learning.”
* “Lovely boy focused on clean code and continuous growth.”
* “Lovely boy turning ideas into software.”

Tell me your preferred tone (cute / serious / humorous) and I can refine further.
